# Password Generator Project

This was another solo project.
Design was provided on figma
I had to build from scratch by looking at the figma design

I hope to improve on its features in th nearest future.
I have created a very basic pasword generator.
On each click, you get 2 randomly created paswords
Length of password is 12

Refresh to restart genration of passwords.
